## Tool Selection Justification
I chose **v0.dev** for this project because of its exceptional ability to generate high-quality React components and Tailwind CSS layouts. Since the project required a sleek, modern UI for a scientific calculator, v0.dev’s focus on "Generative UI" made it the most appealing choice for rapid development without needing local environment setup.

## Development Process
I started the development with a single high-level prompt: "Create a modern, dark-themed scientific calculator with a history sidebar." The tool immediately generated a functional Next.js structure. I then used a few follow-up prompts to refine the scientific functions (sin, cos, tan) and ensure the history panel updated correctly after each calculation. It took approximately 3 iterations to reach the final working version.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge I encountered was ensuring the mathematical logic correctly handled sequential operations. Initially, the AI used a simple evaluation method, but I had to guide it to handle edge cases like "division by zero" more gracefully. v0.dev helped by quickly refactoring the calculation logic when I pointed out these bugs.

## Reflection
What surprised me most about "vibe coding" was how little manual syntax writing was required. The focus shifted from "how to write the loop" to "how the application should behave." This technology changes software development by making it more about architecture and intent rather than just typing code. I would definitely use this tool again for front-end prototyping.
